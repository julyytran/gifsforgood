##Introduction
[gifs_for_good](http://gifsforgood.herokuapp.com/) is an e-commerce shop that sells 'licenses' for gifs created from [lolcommits](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits) to raise funds for select charities. This was created by [July Tran](https://github.com/julyytran), [Heidi Hoopes](https://github.com/hhoopes), and [Brian Rippeto](https://github.com/brianrip), as part of the [Turing School of Software & Design's](https://www.turing.io/) Module 2 curriculum. The shop implements both tags and categories to classify items and offers admin functionality to manage orders and items. Users can add items to their cart and checkout with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).

##Development
This project utilizes Ruby on Rails as a web app framework,
  [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) as our database,
 [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for file attachment & storage, [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for payment processing, and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for styling. The gifs are generated by [lolcommits](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits), which is a gem that takes a picture or a gif of you whenever you commit to git and captions the image with your commit message and SHA.
